# 2. Re:Invent Videos

The following Re:Invent videos cover a large chunk of the material that is in the exam. 
We recommend watching them at 1.5x the speed. 1.5x is fast enough to help get through the videos quickly yet slow enough to be able to comprehend the material.

# 3. Whitepapers

These are to all the whitepapers I read, took notes of and reviewed closer to the exam.
It is tough to actually read all of these as it is a lot of material. You may skim through them but you must be really attentive/focused as you do so. There is a lot of little details in these whitepapers; details that are crucial to passing the exam.

# 4. AWS Free course

We highly recommend going through this amazing, short, FREE course created by AWS:

[Exam Readiness: AWS Certified DevOps Engineer â€“ Professional](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=34146)

This course assumes that you have strong knowledge of the exam material. This course does not cover all the exam material. Instead, this course is about how to approach the different questions in the exam. It breaks down the thought process of those who answer these very challenging questions correctly. We recommend going through this course after you have gone through the above mentioned videos and whitepapers.

# 5. Other supporting material

* Practice Exam: If you have previously taken an AWS exam, you have the benefit of taking a free practice exam. Go to your AWS Certification account > Benefits > Practice Exam and follow the prompts to set it up. This practice exam is vital. It contains a lot of material that is close to the material in the actual exam.

# 8: Exam Strategy

* Keep track of time
* Read both the question and answer in full
* Identify the key words in the question and make sure to satisfy ALL requirements of the question. Two answeres may be very similar but a detail in the question will set them apart.
* Spot the distractor/silly answers. Move on quickly from these.
* Watch out for mental exhaustion. If you feel this, close your eyes and take 5 deep breaths.
* The questions will not be super clear. It's ok to make some assumptions.
* An answer that says "Don't do anything", is not the right answer.
* Avoid answers that have you doing manual commands/process.
* Some answers would not be the best way to do things but could still be right.
* Focus on simplest, most technically correct answers
